          <p>Here are some examples of IT that people use in everday life:</p>
          <p>
<ul>
<li>Personal Computers</li>
<li>Internet</li>
<li>Video conferencing like Skype or Microsoft Teams</li>
<li>Cloud Computing</li>
<li>Virtual Reality</li>
<li>Internet of Things(IoT) more on this later...</li></ul></p>
<p>Here are other types of IT:</p>
<p><ul>
  <li>Communications</li>
  <li>Machine learning</li>
  <li>Artifical Intelligence (AI)</li>
  <li>Cybersecurity</li>
  <li>System Maintenance and Repair</li>
  <li>Analytics</li>
  <li>Software development</li>
  <p><i>Information technology</i> is a vast and widespread term incorporating technology to communicate, transfer data, and process information. Some companies partition IT services by the type of skills that are employed or categorize them into other sections such as Business services, Application services, and Infrastructure services.</p>

          <p>There are many languages in which a software application can be written. The most common languages are HTML and JavaScript, which are used for websites worldwide. Here is a simple example of JavaScript;</p>
          <p>First, a variable is declared, and a value is assigned</p>
          <code>var variableName = 5;</code>
          <p>Now, perform some arithmetic</p>
          <code>variableName += 2;</code>
          <p>Then, print to console</p>
          <code>console.log(variableName);</code>
          <p>To attach 2 strings together or <i>concatenate</i></p>
          <p>First, declare a variable</p>
          <code>var newVariable = "Hello";</code>
          <p>Next, use the addition assignment operator</p>
            <code>newVariable += " World";</code>
            <p>Finally, Print the output to the console</p>
            <code>console.log(newVariable);</code>

          <p>The internet of things, or IoT, is a network of interrelated devices that connect and exchange data with other IoT devices and the cloud. IoT devices are typically embedded with technology such as sensors and software and can include mechanical and digital machines and consumer objects.<cite><a href="https://www.techtarget.com/iotagenda/definition/Internet-of-Things-IoT"> TechTarget</a></cite></p>
          <p>IoT devices are hardware, such as sensors, machines, appliances, and gadgets, that are programmed for specific applications and can transmit data over the internet or other networks.</p>
          <p><p>The 4 Types of IoT Platforms: </p>
<p><ol>
<li>IoT Connectivity Platforms. An IoT Connectivity Platform is used to manage and monitor the communication protocols that connect devices across WiFi, bluetooth, and mobile internet.</li>
<li>IoT Device Management Platforms provide tools for large organizations to monitor, troubleshoot, and update connected devices remotely.</li>
<li>IoT Application Enablement Platforms create and deploy applications that leverage IoT data, whether they're smart home devices or industrial control systems.</li>
<li>IoT Analytics Platforms help organizations gain insight into the data generated by their connected devices.</li>
</ol></p>

<p>There are thousands, in counting, devices that are IoT. Here are some of them, but arent limited to:
<ul>
<li>Smart TV</li>
<li>Smart Watch</li>
<li>Amazon Echo</li>
<li>Ring</li>
<li>Smart thermostat</li>
<li>Smart Lock</li>
