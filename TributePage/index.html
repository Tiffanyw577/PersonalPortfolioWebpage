   <ul id="history">
     <li><b>Pink Floyd</b> are a English rock band formed in London in 1965</li>
     <li><b>Pink Floyd</b> were founded in 1965 by Syd Barrett (guitar, lead vocals), Nick Mason (drums), Roger Waters (bass guitar, vocals) and Richard Wright (keyboards, vocals)</li>
     <li> Barrett created the name on the spur of the moment, first referring to themselves as the Pink Floyd Sound. They would later be referred to as the Pink Floyd and later simply <b>Pink Floyd</b></li>
<li>The name is derived from the given names of two blues musicians whose Piedmont blues records Barrett had in his collection, <b>Pink</b> Anderson and <b>Floyd</b> Council.</li>
<li>In 1967, <b>Pink Floyd</b> began to attract the attention of the music industry. Also, <b>Pink Floyd</b> added guitarist David Gilmour as the fifth member</li>
